            During the summer of 2022 I had the pleasure of working at the Grenoble Electrical Engineering Laboratory in Grenoble, France, with many brilliant researchers.
            While at the lab I spent most of my time working on grid forming inverter control system designs for "microgrid" appilcations (small power grids, typically run on renewable 
            energy sources). I learned a lot working at the lab &ndash; one concept that particularly interested me was Park and Clarke Transforms and their ability to transform
            3-phase AC signals into something that more closely resembles a DC system.
            <br><br>
            Thus, this intial interest has led me here, designing a FOC stepper motor driver from scratch. The PCB I designed uses a dual H-bridge setup to control the coils of the stepper
            It also uses a magnetic encoder for feedback and a daisy-chained power and CAN.
            <br><br>
            This design is still under development, but my up-to-date designs can be found on my GitHub.

              This is where the images in the gallery live. Here's a simple gallery image for you to copy:

              Full Width Image:

                <div class="gallery-image-container">
                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

                </div>

              Half Width Image: 

                <div class="gallery-image-container half-width">
                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

                </div>

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image
