        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text"> After graduating with a degree in Ocean Engineering from Virginia Tech, I wanted to get some hands-on design experience 
            and put my knowledge to the test. Itâ€™s one thing to learn about naval architecture and engineering principles in class, but I wanted to 
            see how I could apply what I learned to a real life design. So, I decided to build my own 6.5 ft electric plywood boat!<br><br>

            This project took me about two months from start to finish. I designed and built the boat completely from scratch, working out of my garage. 
            The main requirements I set for myself were that the boat needed to be small enough to fit inside my Honda CRV, it had to be electric powered 
            so that I could take it out on my community's lakes, and I wanted it to have the look and aesthetics of a classic vintage wooden boat.<br><br>
            
            <b>From Concept to CAD: Turning Ideas into Plans</b><br>
            I started the design by conducting some comparative naval architecture. I began by looking at different hull shapes, configurations, and aeshtetics I liked best 
            and compiled these design characteristics into a vision board. From these images, I sketched a preliminary design of the hull shape. Next, I created a stack-up length
            diagram using the space requirements of all the essential elements of the boat (such as the battery, motor, passenger seat, etc) to derive a minimum boat length 
             and an overall length of the boat. <br><br>
            
            From there, I did a buoyancy check to ensure the hull had enough internal volume to carry the weight of me, a passenger, and all the essential elements with margin.
            Then I laid out the primary structural members and made a CAD drawing of the design. I also ran a righting-arm curve stability analysis to ensure the boat would 
            be safe up to a heel angle of at least 25-deg while fully loaded. Once I completed the CAD design, I transitioned to the hands-on work.<br><br>
            
            <b>The Building Process: Cutting, Assembling, and Fiberglassing</b><br>
            With all the measurements in CAD, I cut the plywood pieces to size and started assembling the frame. It was really rewarding seeing the structure come together 
            nearly identical to the CAD drawing I had designed.<br><br>
            
            After the basic wood hull structure was built, I moved on to the fiberglass and epoxy work. The layup work went smoothly as I was familiar with
            the wet layup process from my time on the Virginia Tech Human Powered Submarine design team.<br><br>
            
            <b>Electrical and Control Systems: Bringing It All to Life</b><br>
            Once the hull was complete, I transitioned my attention to the electronics and controls. I installed an electric trolling motor, battery, and a custom control system -
            similar to the steering system used on a soapbox derby car. It took some trial and error to get everything working smoothly, but finally, I was able to wire
             everything up so the motor responded to the throttle controls and to get the boat steering tolerances smooth and without overshoot.<br><br>
            
            <b>The Finished Product: A Mini, Classic Electric Boat</b><br>
            After two months of work, the boat was finally complete! It fit perfectly inside the back of my Honda CRV, and when I 
            took it out for a test run, it moved through the water well (and without any leaks!). To finish the project off I made a dolly out of PVC pipe and recycled bike tires
            to help maneuver the boat from the car, out to the lake. It was a very fulfilling experience to see this project go from an idea
             in my head to a physical functioning mini-boat! <br><br>
            
            Building this boat gave me invaluable hands-on experience and solidified the value of many of the concepts I had learned during my time at Virginia Tech. 
            Time for boat number two!
