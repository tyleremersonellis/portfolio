          <div class="body-text"> One day while attending my fluid dynamics class we covered an interesting phenmena called the Kármán vortex street - a beautiful
            vortex shedding pattern that forms behind a blunt object in a fluid flow. It amazed me how this chaotic oscillating vortex pattern could be so unique, yet predictable.
             This led me down a rabbit hole of research after class where I found myself digging deeper into research and watching videos of this unique flow pattern in action.

             During my deep dive, I came across something fascinating: fish in rivers and streams often position themselves downstream of rocks and other obstacles to ride
              the trailing Kármán vortex street. By riding these vortices, the fish conserve energy by letting the oscillating flow move their body!<br><br>

              This got me thinking if fish use Kármán vortex streets to their advantage, could I find a way to apply this flow phenomenon in other areas? One idea I came up with
               was to design a small device that could be tied in front of a fishing lure to generate a Kármán vortex street, encouraging the lure to oscillate side-to-side, just 
               like a swimming baitfish or worm. <br><br>

               <b>Bringing the Concept to Life in SOLIDWORKS</b><br>
               To test this idea, I decided to model a series of "wake-making" parts in SOLIDWORKS and run Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations using the software’s 
               built-in CFD tools. The goal was to visualize how each shape influenced the formation of the vortex street's oscillating flow pattern.<br><br>
               
               I created some different variations of the part in CAD and came up with an "acorn-shaped" design and another "flate-plate" design.
               I then set up the CFD simulations to see how water would flow around these shapes at velocities around that of an average fishing line reel re-spool speed.
               The the simulation results are shown below.<br><br>
               
               While I haven't yet had the chance to build and test these prototypes in real-life, this project was valuable in learning more about fluid flows, 
               CFD simulations, and their practical applications to engineering design. <br><br>
