          <div class="body-text">After completing experiments examining brood X cicada wing expansion back in 2021 with
            Dr. Jake Socha's Biomechanics Lab I was offered the unique opportunity to help lead another experiment, but this time... with Migratory Locusts!
            Locusts, being a species of grasshopper, are is that they react to the environmental pressures of their surroundings If you've ever seen one of those videos of large swarms of hungry locusts devouring vegetation, youd know that igratory locusts are unique  wing unfurling process is unique amongst insects for their special ability to
            "autoexpand" their wings. 
            
            The experimental process would be largely the same as the cicada research, except we would be examining 
            While working in the TVC branch it was necessary to draw on much of the knowledge I had learned
            in my control systems courses from my undergraduate studies &ndash; this meant referencing textbooks and trying to track down lecture
            notes, which costed me lots of time and headache.<br><br>

            In an effort to avoid the same fate for my graduate studies, I decided to begin taking notes digitally. This takes a bit more time 
            and effort than traditional pen an paper note taking, but these notes should last me throughout my career. 
            <br> The formatting of my notes
            is heavily based on a blog post from SeniorMars' LaTeX template<br><br>

            Here is an example of some of the notes I have taken so far:<br><br>
